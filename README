My project for the CSUA Hackathon. I was not able to complete it.

The basic idea is that given a set of classes to be taken, recommend which
classes to Phase I and which to Phase II. At the hackathon, I wrote three files,
website.html, website.css, and website.js. The html and css is near complete,
but the js file is essentially 0% complete. I realized with six hours to go
that to make a dynamic website, I would have to learn some server-side programming.
My attempts in the next six hours were unsuccessful. On the bright side, I do 
have another project, namely learn server-side programming.

This was the first web page I have ever written. It was also the first time I 
wrote javascript code. I came in with no idea what JQuery was, after 18 hours I
now have a pretty decent idea of how to modify html elements. Now if I could pick up
server-side programming...
